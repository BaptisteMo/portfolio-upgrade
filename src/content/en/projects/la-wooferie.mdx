## Context

La Wooferie is a premium dog boarding facility located in the Paris region. Founded in 2019, it quickly established itself as a reference thanks to its personalized approach to animal welfare.

However, their booking process relied entirely on phone calls and message exchanges, creating significant friction for both clients and staff.

<Callout type="tip" title="Main objective">
Digitize the booking experience while preserving the personalized dimension that makes La Wooferie's strength.
</Callout>

## Research

We conducted an intensive 3-week research phase to deeply understand the needs of different stakeholders.

### Methodology

- **12 user interviews** with dog owners
- **5 observation sessions** on-site with staff
- **Competitive analysis** of 8 existing solutions
- **Audit of current internal processes**

### Key insights

Dog owners share several common frustrations:

1. The inability to check availability autonomously
2. Lack of visibility on their pet's daily life
3. Complexity in modifying or canceling a booking

<Callout type="info" title="User quote">
"I just want to be able to book in 2 minutes from my couch, like I do for everything else."
</Callout>

## Process

The design was structured in 3 iterative phases, each validated by user testing.

### Phase 1: Information architecture

Definition of product structure and main flows. We used card sorting workshops to organize features intuitively.

### Phase 2: Wireframes and prototyping

Creation of low-fidelity wireframes, then iteration towards interactive prototypes. Each screen was tested with at least 5 users.

### Phase 3: UI design and handoff

Finalization of visual design in accordance with La Wooferie's brand identity. Comprehensive documentation for developers.

## Solution

The final application includes three main modules:

### Client portal

- Online booking with real-time calendar
- Detailed pet profile (food, medications, habits)
- Daily tracking with photos and staff notes

### Back-office management

- Optimized planning view for staff
- Capacity and pricing management
- Automated client communication

### Mobile application

- Push notifications for updates
- Photo gallery of the pet during their stay
- Integrated secure payment

<Callout type="tip" title="Key innovation">
The "logbook" system allows owners to follow their pet's daily life with daily photos and notes.
</Callout>

## Results

After 3 months of deployment, results exceeded initial objectives:

- **+240%** increase in online bookings
- **-65%** reduction in administrative time
- **4.8/5** average customer satisfaction
- **92%** of clients now use the online portal

Booking processing time went from an average of 15 minutes to less than 2 minutes, freeing staff to focus on welcoming and caring for animals.
